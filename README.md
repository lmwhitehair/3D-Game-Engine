# 3D-Game-Engine
I am editing this code that was initialling posted here:https://www.instructables.com/id/Making-a-Basic-3D-Engine-in-Java/. I want to create a game with this code as a base.

Current features: Ability to run around the map using WASD.

Future features: Ability to jump, sprint, and crouch. Fullscreen mode, and constant spawning monsters to fight.

Current bugs: Textures arent implementing
